                <h3>Foundations</h3>
                <p>Founded amongst the rubble of the post-pandemic wastelands, Seal Team Six was formed out of a mutual interest in survival RPG games.<br>
                Before the Team was formed, it started off as a group of random dudes playing the same game at the right moment. The group quickly banded together<br>
                and began a journey together that has spanned universes.
                </p>
                <p>Even when the realities of life have shifted our priorities, we still manage to find the time to come together.</p>
